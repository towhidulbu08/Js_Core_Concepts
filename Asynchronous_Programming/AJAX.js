// XHR= XML HTTP request
//JSON vs XML
//JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.
//XML is a markup language that defines rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
//JSON is primarily used for data interchange, while XML is used for document markup.
//JSON is less verbose than XML, making it more efficient for data interchange.
//REST API= Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface
//AJAX= Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
//AJAX is a technique for creating asynchronous web applications.
//It allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server in the background.
//AJAX is not a programming language, but a combination of technologies.
//AJAX is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
//AJAX is a client-side technology, meaning it runs in the user's browser.
//AJAX is used to send and receive data from a server without refreshing the entire page.
//There are three ways to make an AJAX or Http  request:
//1. XMLHttpRequest
//2. Fetch API
//3.axios
//XMLHttpRequest is the traditional way to make AJAX requests.
//It is a built-in JavaScript object that allows you to send and receive data from a server.
//The Fetch API is a modern way to make AJAX requests.
//It is a built-in JavaScript function that returns a promise.
//Axios is a third-party library that makes it easy to make AJAX requests.
//It is built on top of the XMLHttpRequest object and provides a simpler API.
//The Fetch API is a modern way to make AJAX requests.
